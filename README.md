# Design - Developing optimal design

These files are the source codes to reproduce the papers results entited: "Comparison of a systematic design with some spatially optimized design, particularly in the presence of residual competition".

You need to run the files below in this sequence:

1. optimalDesigns.R
2. SimulatedEffects.R
3. AnalysesDesign.R
4. AnalysesDesign2.R
5. AnalysesDesign5.R
6. results_graphics.R

The R.DATA are the results.
(i) Optimaldesign_results.RData has all the 11 designs frow optimalDesigns.R file
(ii) SimulatedEffects.RData has two sets for the environmental simulated effects (uni1 and uni2) and one set for the genetic environmental simulated effects frow SimulatedEffects.R
(iii) Results.RData has the results for each design-scenario combination frow  AnalysesDesign.R, AnalysesDesign2.R and AnalysesDesign5.R files.
